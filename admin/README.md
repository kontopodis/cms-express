User API

**Rules**

#### Thoughts 
Any given data by the API should never have any info like:
 1) password, 
 2) hash,
 3) Id, 
 4) email
   
All the outputs of the Api have to be cotrolled: 
* no sql logging

For this propably needs a file full of all the outputs i like to send. An Object of responses

#### Things on progress:
* JSON Web Tokens
* User types:
   1) public
   2) private
  
#### Things for the future:
1) As with user same things for Articles
2) Static web pages? Propably just diferent route directory
3) Back end client side... propably React.
